// REVIEW: Instead of a global `articles = []` array, let's attach this list of all articles directly to the constructor function. Note: it is NOT on the prototype. In JavaScript, functions are themselves objects, which means we can add properties/values to them at any time. In this case, the array relates to ALL of the Article objects, so it does not belong on the prototype, as that would only be relevant to a single instantiated Article.
Article.all = [];

// COMMENT: Why isn't this method written as an arrow function?
// Because this is a prototype function, which is dependant upon a contextual this.
Article.prototype.toHtml = function() {
  let template = Handlebars.compile($('#article-template').text());

  this.daysAgo = parseInt((new Date() - new Date(this.publishedOn))/60/60/24/1000);

  // COMMENT: What is going on in the line below? What do the question mark and colon represent? How have we seen this same logic represented previously?
  // Not sure? Check the docs!
  // It's a conditional ternary operator. If the initial statement is not true, then use the statement after the colon. It replaces an if/else statement more concisely.
  this.publishStatus = this.publishedOn ? `published ${this.daysAgo} days ago` : '(draft)';
  this.body = marked(this.body);

  return template(this);
};

// REVIEW: There are some other functions that also relate to all articles across the board, rather than just single instances. Object-oriented programming would call these "class-level" functions, that are relevant to the entire "class" of objects that are Articles.

// REVIEW: This function will take the rawData, how ever it is provided, and use it to instantiate all the articles. This code is moved from elsewhere, and encapsulated in a simply-named function for clarity.

// COMMENT: Where is this function called? What does 'rawData' represent now? How is this different from previous labs?
// This function is called twice in the fetchAll. Once in the if, and again in the else. rawData now represents the information in localStorage that was retrieved from the JSON file.
Article.loadAll = articleData => {
  articleData.sort((a,b) => (new Date(b.publishedOn)) - (new Date(a.publishedOn)))

  articleData.forEach(articleObject => Article.all.push(new Article(articleObject)))
}

// REVIEW: This function will retrieve the data from either a local or remote source, and process it, then hand off control to the View.
Article.fetchAll = () => {
  // REVIEW: What is this 'if' statement checking for? Where was the rawData set to local storage?
  if (localStorage.rawData) {
    Article.loadAll(JSON.parse(localStorage.rawData));
    articleView.initIndexPage()    

  } else {
    $.getJSON('/data/hackerIpsum.json')
      .then(
        // SUCCESS CALLBACK
        function(data) {
          Article.loadAll(data);
          localStorage.setItem('rawData', JSON.stringify(data));
          articleView.initIndexPage();
        },
        function(err) {
          console.error(err);
        }
      )
  }
  // When fetchAll runs, check if there is localStorage. If there is, parse that data, then initialize the page. If there isn't localStorage, pull the JSON data, stringify it to put it into local storage, and then initialize the page. We determined the correct sequence, through tiral and error, and by console logging what was happening (thanks, Nicholas).
