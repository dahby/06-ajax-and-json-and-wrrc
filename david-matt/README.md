# jQuery AJAX & JSON

**Author**: David Stoll and Matt Harding
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This blog application pulls its data from a JSON file and logs it in localStorage for future use.

## Getting Started
- First we reviewed the code base
- Then we worked on populating local storage
- Then we determined the correct sequence of operations to initialize the page when there is existing local data, and also when there is not.

## Architecture
HTML5, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, Handlebars
